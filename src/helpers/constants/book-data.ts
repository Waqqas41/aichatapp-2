Apple Intelligence
AI‑opening possibilities.1
Apple Intelligence coming this December1
Our latest iPhone models are built for Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that helps you write, express yourself and get things done effortlessly. With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data — not even Apple.1
Writing Tools can proofread your text and rewrite different versions until the tone is just right, and summarize selected text with a simple tap. They're available nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps.
Make a Genmoji right in the keyboard to match any conversation. Want to create a rainbow cactus? You got it. Just provide a description to see a preview.
Awareness of your personal context enables Siri to help you in ways that are unique to you. Can’t remember when your mom’s flight is arriving? Siri can help find what you’re looking for, without compromising your privacy.
With Private Cloud Compute, Apple Intelligence can draw on larger, Apple‑designed server‑based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests while protecting your privacy.
Cutting-Edge Cameras
Picture your best photos and videos.
The advanced cameras in iPhone automatically capture phenomenal photos with great detail and colour. Want to take the perfect shot in record time? Our latest models have Camera Control, giving you an easier way to quickly access camera tools.
iPhone records in HDR, so whether you use Action mode to steady really shaky scenes as you shoot or capture striking slo‑mo shots in 4K 120 fps Dolby Vision on iPhone 16 Pro — every frame looks incredible.
With a wide range of focal lengths, iPhone gives you exceptional framing flexibility — from sharp close‑ups to sweeping Ultra Wide shots that let you capture more of a scene without stepping back.
Chip and Battery Life
Fast that lasts.
iPhone chips enhance everything you do. Our latest chips unlock Apple Intelligence, power advanced photo features like latest‑generation Photographic Styles, and enable AAA gaming.
Our hardware and software are designed to work together efficiently, so you can do more on a single charge — like watching up to 33 hours of video on iPhone 16 Pro Max.2
iPhone + 5G = a super fast experience.3 And when you don’t need all that speed, iPhone shifts into Smart Data mode to preserve battery life.
Snap on a new MagSafe Charger.4 Or plug in a USB‑C Power Adapter. iPhone 15 and later also have USB‑C, so you can charge your iPhone with the same cable as your Mac and iPad.5
Innovation
Beautiful and durable, by design.
iPhone is known for its iconic design and premium materials — like iPhone 16 Pro, which is forged in titanium. On the brilliant display, Dynamic Island bubbles up important info so you don’t miss a beat.
iPhone has a Ceramic Shield material that’s tougher than any smartphone glass. Little spill? No biggie — iPhone also stands up to splashes from everyday liquids like water, coffee and soda.6
We design our hardware and software together for a seamless experience. Want to share your contact info? Hold your iPhone close to theirs. New AirPods? It’s a one‑tap setup. And regular iOS updates keep your iPhone feeling new for years to come.
Environment
Recycle. Reuse. Repeat.
Our disassembly robots — Daisy, Dave and Taz — recover crucial materials like gold, cobalt, tungsten and rare earth elements from recycled iPhone devices, so they can be used to make new ones.
We’re significantly expanding the use of key recycled metals in iPhone batteries, magnets and circuit boards. Case in point: Our latest models contain 95 percent recycled lithium in the battery cathode — a first for Apple.7
When you’re ready to buy a new iPhone, you can trade in your current iPhone or Android device and apply any credit toward your purchase. If your device isn’t eligible for credit, we’ll recycle it for free.
For the first time, iPhone packaging is 100 percent fibre-based.8 And there’s no plastic wrap in or around the box.
Our stores, offices and data centres are already carbon-neutral. By 2030, Apple will be carbon-neutral across our entire carbon footprint.
Privacy
Your data. Just where you want it.
Apple Intelligence is integrated into your iPhone through on-device processing. With Private Cloud Compute, it can draw on larger, Apple-designed server-based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests while protecting your privacy.
The new Passwords app makes it easier to access account passwords, passkeys, Wi‑Fi passwords and two‑factor authentication codes stored securely on your device or synced with iCloud Keychain.
Private Browsing in Safari locks browsing windows when they’re not being used, blocks known trackers from loading on pages and removes tracking added to URLs as you browse.
All messages sent with iMessage use end-to-end encryption between devices, so they’re only seen by those you send them to. And Mail Privacy Protection hides your IP address, so senders can’t determine your location.
When you make a purchase with Apple Pay, your card numbers are never stored on your device or on Apple servers — and they’re never shared by Apple with merchants, either.9
Customize Your iPhone
Make it you. Through and through.
Swap out your Lock Screen controls for ones you use more often — you can even assign a control to the Action button. Tint your Home Screen icons and widgets or let iOS choose a colour to match your wallpaper.
Built-in accessibility features help you do what you love in the ways that work best for you. For example, Eye Tracking lets you navigate iPhone with just your eyes, thanks to the power of on-device machine learning and the front-facing camera.
Peace of Mind
Helpful safety features. Just in case.
Unique safety features allow iPhone to connect to satellite frequencies — so you can send and receive messages via satellite or text emergency services when you don’t have cell service or Wi-Fi.10
With Find My, you can securely share your location with friends and family. And in Messages, you can use Check In to automatically let someone know when you’ve reached your destination safely.
